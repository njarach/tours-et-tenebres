RPG Blog made for fun with symfony. 

Had fun experimenting, using Obsidian to write content (.md files) and setting up Symfony and Twig to read the content, display the directory tree as a sidebar, add some styles...
The project is using bootstrap 5.3 for styles, and HTMX sprinkled on top because it's always nice and easy to add. 
Content is WiP, code also. Project could probably use custom routing to better handle file based routing ? I don't know.
